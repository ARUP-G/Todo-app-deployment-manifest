# Todo-app-deployment-manifests

This repository contains the deployment manifests for deploying the Todo App on Kubernetes. It includes the necessary YAML files for deploying the application using Kubernetes.

## Deploy Folder Structure
```bash
deploy/
│
├── deploy.yaml
└── service.yaml
```
### Files Description:

- **deploy.yaml**: This YAML file contains the deployment configuration for the Todo App. It specifies the deployment strategy, pod template, container specifications, and any other necessary configurations for running the application.

- **service.yaml**: This YAML file defines the Kubernetes service configuration for the Todo App. It specifies how the service should be exposed within the Kubernetes cluster, including the service type, ports, and any other relevant settings.

## Deployment Instructions:

To deploy the Todo App using these manifests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have `kubectl` configured to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `deploy` folder.

3. Apply the deployment and service manifests using `kubectl apply`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f deploy/service.yaml
```
4. Verify that the deployment and service are created successfully:
```bash

kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
```
5. Access the Todo App using the appropriate service endpoint as per your Kubernetes setup.
